# Data

## DIPA dataset

Many of the files for this dataset are already in the repo, but to download
the full set of images, annotations, and labels, run the script
seteup.sh in data/dipa.

## object classes

At present, the mapping from object classes to numerical labels is

{"face": 0, "license plate": 1, "picture": 2, "street sign": 3}
