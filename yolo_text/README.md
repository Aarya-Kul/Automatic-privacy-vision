## Purpose

This is a separate YOLO model trained on COCO-text. 
It is not clear whether it has any advantage over simply using specialized OCR for text detection.
We can, however, try finetuning this on our custom dataset.


## TODO

If we want to use this model, we should try running for more than 50 epochs.
